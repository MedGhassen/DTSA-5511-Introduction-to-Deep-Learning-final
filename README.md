# Alzheimer Detection using CNN

## Introduction
This Jupyter notebook focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting Alzheimer's disease from brain scans. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Xception and EfficientNetB7 models, we aim to classify brain images accurately, identifying markers of Alzheimer's and differentiating between the stages of the disease. This approach, leveraging transfer learning, seeks to enhance diagnostic precision with the limited data available.

## Data Source
The brain scan images used in this study are sourced from the following Kaggle dataset: [Alzheimer's MRI Brain Scan Images Augmented](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/alzheimers-mri-brain-scan-images-augmented).
